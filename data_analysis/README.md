## Data analysis notebooks for COMM318 _Stories from data_ Final Project

* This folder should contain the a series of Jupyter notebooks you create to do the data analysis.

* Update this README file to document the notebooks and give a short description of what each one does.

first_looks_at_data: For this notebook, I went over the initate colleges.csv numbers. I got a basic feel for what the NYT dataframe proved for me.

second_looks_at_data: For this notebook, I started extracting the data I wanted. I seperated the ivy league schools from the entire dataframe and compared them to the corresponding state schools. I also combined multiple campus entries for a single school because they are technically a part of the same school.

third_looks_at_data: for this notebook, I found the population of each of the schools I was looking at. Since there is not a central data set for this, I looked for them by school website.

fourth_looks_at_data: for this notebook, I looked into the data for COVID cases for the entire U.S. by state. Then I found the number of cases for the states of the ivy schools I was looking into. I used the latest available date in the dataframe.
