## Data files for COMM318 _Stories from data_ Final Project

* This folder should contain the data files you have used in your analysis


* You should update this README file to list and describe the files.


* You can also create additional sub-folders to better organize your data.
    * For example, you could have a folder called `raw` or `orig` to contain the original data files you downloaded and then a folder called `final` or `clean` that contains versions of these data sheets that you have worked with to clean up missing data, to subset or merge etc.
    
    
Research question: How have colleges handle the COVID-19 pandemic? Comparing ivy league schools to state schools, which set is doing better in terms of testing, confirming cases, and being transparent about their data? I also then want to compare the amount of COVID-19 cases from colleges and universities in each state to the number of cases in that state to see exactly how much college students are contributing to the spread of COVID-19.


Datasets from the New York Times:
    colleges.csv - total ofcases sort by colleges/universities, not comprehensive/complete
    us.csv - total of cases in the U.S. sort by date
    us_states.csv - total of cases in U.S. sort by state
